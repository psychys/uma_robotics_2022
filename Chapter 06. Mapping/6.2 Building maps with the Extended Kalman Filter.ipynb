    "## 6.2.1 Formalizing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are going to build a map of $N$ landmarks, the position of those landmarks in the map $m$ are the random variables to be estimated. In this way, the state vector in the mapping case is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = [m_1, m_2, \\cdots, m_N] = \n",
    "[x_1, y_1, \\underbrace{x_2, y_2}_{\\text{Position of}\\\\\\text{landmark 2}}, \\dots,x_N, y_N]^T, \\ \\ \\ len(m) = 2N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we pursuit the estimation of the probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(m | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "being $z_{1:t}$ the sensor measurements taken until time instant $t$, and $x_{1:t}$ the robot poses from which those measurements were acquired. Recall that a sensor measurement is related to the pose $x$ and the map $m$ by means of the **observation function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = h(x,m) + e \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, e \\sim N(0,Q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two assumptions are made when building maps using EFK.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 1: each landmark position is estimated independently\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplifying the problem, it is usual to assume that the estimation of the position of the landmarks is independent one to another, only depending each one on its observations, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(m_i|z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = p(m_i |z^i_{1:t}, x_{1:t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which results in the following simplification:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(m | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t})= p(m_1, m_2, \\cdots, m_N | z_{1:t}, x_{1:t}) = \\prod_{k=1}^N p(m_i | z^i_{1:t}, x_{1:t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of this, the estimation of, for example, 3 landmarks simultaneously is the same as using three concurrent and independent EKFs for estimating them. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 2: the map is static\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the localization case, where the robot pose changed over time, in this case it is assumed that the map is static, that is, the landmarks are still. This means that in the state transition model $m_k=m_{k-1}$, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_t = A_t m_{t-1} + B_t u_t + \\epsilon_t \\ \\ \\ \\ (A=I, u=0, \\epsilon=0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So good news here!, there is no need for a prediction step in the EKF, we only have to model the correction (update) one. "
