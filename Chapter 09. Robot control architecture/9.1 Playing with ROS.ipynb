If you choose this option, you have to know that the `open_gmapping` package is not available for ROS Melodic in the Ubuntu package repository. That package is a wrapper for **GMapping**, a SLAM method **based on particle filters** that we are going to use. However, it is easy to compile it from source. For doing that, execute the following commands:\n",
